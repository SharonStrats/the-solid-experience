# The Solid Experience

This project has two purposes. One is to gather feedback about SolidOS, the Open Source Operating System (Frontend) to Solid Servers. The second is to explore and gain insight into the new possibilities of how, as users, we can experience our data in the Solid ecosystem now that we are no longer tied to having individual companies control different aspects of our data. One of the beautiful things about Solid is that our data is not only our own, all the different types of data that we may hold can all be used together seamlessly.
